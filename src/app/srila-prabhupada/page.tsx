                Born Abhay Charan De in Calcutta in 1896, Srila Prabhupada was raised with devotion to Krishna from childhood. As a young man he studied, worked, and lived a responsible family life, but the central instruction of his life came in 1922 when he met Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura: take the teachings of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to the English-speaking world.
              </p>
              <p>
                More than four decades later, after accepting sannyasa and publishing early volumes of Srimad-Bhagavatam, he boarded the cargo ship Jaladuta in 1965. He arrived in America with little money, no institution waiting for him, and a trunk of books. In July 1966 he incorporated ISKCON in New York City.
              </p>
              <p>
                In only twelve years, his small storefront mission became an international society with temples, farms, schools, restaurants, book distribution, public kirtan, deity worship, and prasadam service across continents. His achievement was not only organizational; it was deeply personal. He gave people a daily practice, a spiritual family, and a way to live in relationship with Krishna.

                <p>
                  ISKCON's early Kenyan work began remarkably soon after the society was founded. Srila Prabhupada came to Nairobi in 1971, giving darshan, leading kirtan, lecturing in the evenings, and encouraging the devotees who were trying to establish Krishna consciousness in East Africa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nairobi was not peripheral to him. He instructed his leaders that Kenya was an African country and that Krishna consciousness should be shared with African people, not only with the resident Indian community. That instruction still shapes the heart of ISKCON Nairobi's outreach, education, Food For Life, and student work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1972, Srila Prabhupada personally installed Sri Sri Radha Bankebihari in Nairobi. The worship, kirtan, prasadam, and hospitality offered today at Hare Krishna Close stand in continuity with that personal blessing.
