      "When autumn arrived, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu desired to go to Vrindavan. In a solitary place, He spoke with Ramananda Raya and Svarupa Damodara Gosvami, asking them to help Him leave for Vrindavan.",
      "The Lord told them that He would depart very early in the morning, quietly and without being seen. He would not take the well-known public road. He wanted to travel secretly through the forest, and He wished to go alone. If anyone tried to follow Him, He asked that they be stopped.",
      "He also asked them not to be unhappy. If they gave Him permission with joy, He said, then He would be happy on His way to Vrindavan.",
      "Ramananda Raya and Svarupa Damodara replied that the Lord was completely independent. He was not dependent on anyone, and He would certainly do whatever He desired. Still, they placed one request before Him, because He had said that He would be happy if they were happy.",
      "They begged Him to take at least one gentle and qualified brahmana. Such a person could collect alms, cook for Him, offer Him prasadam, and carry His waterpot while traveling. They explained that in the jungle there might be no brahmana from whom the Lord could accept lunch, so one pure brahmana should accompany Him.",
      "Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu answered that He would not take any of His close associates, because if He chose one of them, the others would be unhappy. If someone were to go, that person would have to be new, peaceful, and suitable for the journey.",
      "Svarupa Damodara then proposed Balabhadra Bhattacharya. He was deeply attached to the Lord, honest, learned, and advanced in spiritual consciousness. He had originally come with the Lord from Bengal, and he also desired to see the holy places of pilgrimage.",
      "Svarupa Damodara also suggested that another brahmana could go as a servant to help on the way, carry the Lord's cloth and waterpot, and make arrangements for food. Balabhadra Bhattacharya would collect alms and cook for the Lord. With two people accompanying Him through the jungle, there would be no difficulty.",
      "Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu accepted this request. On the previous night, He went to see Lord Jagannatha and took His permission. Then, near the end of the night, before others could see Him, the Lord rose and immediately began His journey.",
